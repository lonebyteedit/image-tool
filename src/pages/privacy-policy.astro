                    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Welcome to image-tool.org ("we", "our", "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our website and services.</p>

                    </ul>
            
                    <h2>3. Information We Collect</h2>
                    <p>We may collect non-personally identifiable information to improve our website and services. This includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Analytics Data:</strong> We may use privacy-respecting analytics tools to collect anonymous usage data, such as the number of visitors, pages visited, and features used. This data is aggregated and cannot be used to identify you personally.</li>
                        <li><strong>Technical Information:</strong> We may collect anonymous technical information, such as browser type, operating system, and device type, to ensure compatibility and optimize user experience.</li>

                    <h2>4. Cookies and Local Storage</h2>
